This project is focused on implementing a Tensor Processing unit. The current status of the project is incomplete. The code matrix_unit_tb.v can demostrate systolic matrix multiplication. It is being extended to perform systolic 2D convolution. The test.v provides a random input to the Matrix Multiplication unit whose width is taken as an input. The lanuage used is system verilog.
